## About the CC01
This ☒CHIP forms part of the core CPU modules and is based on the low-power ATmega328P from Atmel, which is an 8-bit AVR Microcontroller with 32 KB flash memory, 1 KB EEPROM and 2 KB internal SRAM. It is natively supported in Arduino due to the ATmega328P architecture being shared with the Arduino UNO.

More information on the ATmega328P can be found in the [datasheet](http://www.atmel.com/images/Atmel-8271-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega48A-48PA-88A-88PA-168A-168PA-328-328P_datasheet_Complete.pdf).
